Gotta start somewhere!
Turn it up. Lock in. Be the one.
This isn’t a track—it’s a full-body experience. Plug in.
Mood: drifting through life in surround‑sound serenity.
Good friends, good music—what else do you even need?
Laid-back, tuned-in, feelin’ fine.
Turn it up, keep it moving. Then we can go all night!
Just shut the door and pump the brakes…, yeah!
Not your typical love song — more like a lucid dream with bass
Fast Money on the dash
Dead girl? Nah. Just some BASSSSSSS
I am so done, I can't sleep....
Essa Mi, Essa Mi, Essa Mi feel the rhythm.
Will you comfort me, lets dance!
When the night feels hard, remember: you never walk alone.
Go Kara, do it, do it ...... DnB 
Timmy Trumpet, Pulsing beats and uplifting energy
Suddenly we have no time, YEAH! Goosebumps.....
