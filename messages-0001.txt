Gotta start somewhere!
Fern Tells
Turn it up. Lock in. Be the one.
This isn’t a track—it’s a full-body experience. Plug in.
Mood: drifting through life in surround‑sound serenity.
Good friends, good music—what else do you even need?
Laid-back, tuned-in, feelin’ fine.
Turn it up, keep it moving. Then we can go all night!
Just shut the door and pump the brakes…, yeah!
Not your typical love song — more like a lucid dream with bass
Fast Money on the dash
Dead girl? Nah. Just some BASSSSSSS
I am so done, I can't sleep....
